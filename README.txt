#todo list 

This is a Python program that writes a message to a file. 
The program takes the current date and time and formats it as a string. 
It then prompts the user to enter a message and writes it to a file with the name of the current date. 
The program uses the `open()` function in Python to write to a file.
You can specify either `“w” or “a”` as a parameter to write to a file. “w” overwrites the existing content of a file while “a” appends content to a file
